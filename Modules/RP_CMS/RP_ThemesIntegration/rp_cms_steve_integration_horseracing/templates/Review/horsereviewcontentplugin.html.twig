          <h5>SPONSORED REVIEW - THIS REVIEW SOLELY REPRESENTS THE OPINION OF THE WRITER</h5>
          <p>We found out that the <a href="#">bet365</a> online gambling empire was founded in the year 2000 on the back of the betting shop business built up since 1974 by Peter Coates, the Stoke City FC chairman. Growing swiftly since its inception we heard that <a href="#">bet365</a> takes a reported £5 billion in sports bets which generates hefty profits.</p>
          <p>Based in Stoke-on-Trent, they have not followed some of their rivals offshore, and use, in our opinion, their strong reputation for fair prices, innovative gambling products and first class customer service to continue to blossom in a competitive industry. One of the first bookmakers to embrace live in-play betting, they also allow customers to watch many sporting events live through their impressive website, including horse racing.</p>

          <h5>WHAT ARE THEIR PRICES LIKE?</h5>
          <p>We saw that the best price Guaranteed and price promise ensures that <a href="#">bet365</a>'s prices are right at the topside of what punters can hope to find anywhere. Going out of their way to match the best price available with some of their main rivals can mean it saves you the bother of spending time trying to find the best price.</p>
          <p>Another positive aspect we noticed is that <a href="#">bet365</a> no longer impose 5p Rule 4 deductions. When a horse is withdrawn at odds of between 10/1 and 14/1, bookmakers normally make a 5p in the pound deduction to winnings but not this bookie.</p>

          <h5>CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CONTACT METHODS</h5>
          <p>We found the following contact methods: <a href="#">bet365</a> offer numerous contact methods including email, web messaging, a call back service, telephone, fax, post or the live chat facility.</p>
          <p>Their phone lines, emails and live chat are manned 24/7.</p>

          <h5>REVIEWER'S VERDICT</h5>
          <p>All in all, in our own honest opinion <a href="#">bet365</a> is one of the industry's great bookmakers. They offer free bets, promotions and ongoing offers that outstrip pretty much anything else available anywhere, especially for horse racing betting. Their website, live streaming and customer service functions all run efficiently and even with a little panache and, to be honest, we don't really have a bad word to say against them. So, unless you're not a fan of the colour green, we think you'll like <a href="#">bet365</a>. A lot.</p>

          <h5>HORSE RACING LIVE STREAMING</h5>
          <p>We've learned that you can watch every single horse race from the UK and Ireland live on <a href="#">bet365</a> using At The Races and Racing UK streaming, and you only have to bet £0.50 on the race in question for the privilege.</p>
          <p>To start watching, simply login to your account, place your bet and then click on the Race-RES link for the race you wish to watch on the horse racing homepage. You should then click the Live Stream link above the race result. The process is very simple and the user interface is intuitive with help and FAQ options in the right-hand sidebar.</p>
          <p>Obviously you will require broadband to receive good picture quality but there is plenty of technical help on the site, and the pictures we experienced were seamless.</p>

          <h5>HORSE RACING BET TYPES OFFERED</h5>
          <p>As well as finding out that <a href="#">bet365</a> ensures they give early prices on every UK and Irish horse race, and that they are offering the usual range of horse racing betting options, they offer Showcasts (fixed price straight forecasts and tricasts) on all UK and Irish horse races when prices are available. Note that tricasts are offered for races of eight or more runners, but the Best Odds Guaranteed offer applies to all Showcast bets.</p>
          <p>They have a pleasing habit of offering enhanced place terms on plenty of the big races throughout the year. We found out they also pay out on disqualified horses and the official winner on all win and each way bets on horse racing in the UK and Ireland, including bets placed ante-post. The steward's enquiry will no longer put you out of pocket.</p>

          <h5>WEBSITE USABILITY</h5>
          <p>We find that the website itself is as clear and easy to use as any in the industry. The 'Services' menu bar in the top right of the screen is a particularly useful one-stop shop to find the information you need without having to scroll or search too hard.</p>
